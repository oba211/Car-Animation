Design a running car animation using HTML and CSS
Car Runing Animation project is a web application which is developed in HTML CSS platform
 In this project, going to implement a car running on a track using HTML and CSS with sound effects.

 1 First will make HTML file and then add all the images using HTML Image Tag, have Images of Road, Buildings, Sky, Wheels and the body of the car.
 
 2 Then will do the styling of these images, the main goal is to position all main items as shown in main image
 
 3 First of all I have set padding and margin of body of our document to zero pixels and removed the scroll bar from browser by setting value of overflow property to hidden.
 
 4 Then i have done styling of both images of Road to position it at it's place using road class.
 
 5 Then I have done styling of building images to set them in the background class.
 
 6 after I did some styling to the position the body of car in the middle of the road using car class.Road Animation: I have used keyframes and road1 and road 2 class to change the position of both road images, the whole process of animation will take 10 seconds.
 Building Animation: I have used keyframes and building1 and building2 class to change the position of both building images, the whole process of animation will take 10 seconds as well.
